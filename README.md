# Java-Lab-Inventory-Management-Application
The Lab Inventory Management Application (LIMA) is a Java-based software designed to assist Lab Technicians in managing the inventory of the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. The project aims to streamline the process of borrowing items for student projects while ensuring efficient inventory tracking and monitoring.

LIMA provides a user-friendly interface for both Technicians and Students. Technicians have exclusive access to add, edit, and delete items from the inventory, as well as monitor the real-time inventory status. They can view a dashboard that displays the details of each item, including the number of pieces borrowed and available. Technicians can also search for items by name and manage student records, including their borrowing history and return deadlines.

Students are required to register with their university ID, name, password, and phone number to access the system. Once logged in, they can browse the available items, search for specific items, and add them to their borrowing cart. They have the flexibility to review, modify, or finalize their request before submitting it. Upon completion, a request form is generated, including the borrowed item details, date and time, student information, and return deadlines. Technicians then approve and hand over the requested items to the students.

The LIMA project incorporates object-oriented design principles, such as class inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It utilizes Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) implementation, allowing for a seamless user experience. The application also emphasizes data management by storing student information, inventory details, and borrowing records in files for easy retrieval and tracking.

Overall, LIMA enhances the efficiency and accuracy of managing lab inventory, streamlines the borrowing process for students, and ensures timely returns and replenishment of items. It serves as a comprehensive tool for Lab Technicians to effectively supervise the lab inventory, track student borrowing activities, and facilitate smooth lab operations.
